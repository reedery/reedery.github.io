    <h2 ><strong>about</strong></h2>

<p class="text">    
    Hey there. I'm Ryan and I call the colorful and diverse city of
    Los Angeles, home. Growing up with access to tools like Photoshop 
    and After Effects taught me things about computers, creativity 
    and problem-solving that play a vital role in my life every day. 
</p>

<p class="text">
    I devote my time and energy to making technology more accesible
    for everyone. I think that spatial computing (AR/VR/XR) is the most ergonomic, 
    creative and powerful human-computer interaction paradigm yet and the stakes 
    are very high for responsible use of it. At Teleportal,
    we are working to ensure a privacy and accesibility-focused future for spatial computing.
    At Tecnolatinx XR Labs, we bring emerging tech like VR headsets into 
    classrooms so students with no access to VR otherwise, can create and wonder.

</p>

<p class="text">
        For fun I like to cook, run and draw. Plastic Beach is my favorite 
        record and <em>The Iron Giant</em> is my favorite film. I am far from perfect, but I do my best to learn from my mistakes
        and be a better me each day. Practice makes perfect.
 </p>

        Thanks for reading and say hello please :)

                Tecnolatinx XR Labs (TLX) makes emerging technology (AR/VR) 
                more accessible by providing lab space and curriculum to students 
                from underserved communities. TLX students learn 3D art, programming, 
                instruct courses and gain economic mobility through having a direct 
                understanding of what the future of work looks like.

                In August of 2017, I spoke at the International Association for the Study of Irish Literatures 
                conference at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) about our digital humanities project, Joycestick.
                To an audience of educators from around the world, I presented information on how interactive narratives
                can be produced for Virtual Reality and how to replicate the production effort of Joycestick at other 
                undergraduate institutions. LINK: https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/get-into-a-novel-via-virtual-reality

                In March of 2019, Joycestick was given the opportunity to present at the 2019 Game Developers Conference. My portion
                of our 3-person talk was (a) a post-mortem on the project from my perspective as the producer and teaching assistant, 
                and (b) thoughts on how more diverse talent pipelines for indiscipline projects can be built.

                In June of 2019, I presented a 30-minute trip through the feature animation production pipeline to inspire young students
                to learn more about 3D graphics and consider careers in the industry.
