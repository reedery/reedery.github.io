    <h2 ><strong>about</strong></h2>

<p class="text">    
    Hey! I'm Ryan from Manhattan Beach, California.
    Growing up with access to tools like Photoshop 
    and After Effects taught me things about computers, creativity 
    and problem-solving that play a vital role in my life every day. 
</p>

<p class="text">
    I devote my energy to making technology more accessible
    for everyone. I think that spatial computing (AR/VR/XR) is the most ergonomic, 
    creative and powerful human-computer interaction paradigm yet and the stakes 
    are very high for responsible use of it. At Teleportal,
    we are working to ensure a privacy and accesibility-focused future for spatial computing.
    At Tecnolatinx XR Labs, we bring emerging tech like VR headsets into 
    classrooms so students with no access to VR otherwise, can create and wonder.

</p>

<p class="text">
        For fun I like to cook, run and draw. Plastic Beach is my favorite 
        record and <em>The Iron Giant</em> is my favorite film. I am far from perfect, but I do my best to learn from my mistakes
        and be a better me each day. Practice makes perfect.
 </p>

        Thanks for reading and say hello !

                In August of 2017, I spoke at the International Association for the Study of Irish Literatures 
                conference at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) about our digital humanities project, Joycestick.
                To an audience of educators from around the world, I presented information on how interactive narratives
                can be produced for Virtual Reality and how to replicate the production effort of Joycestick at other 
                undergraduate institutions. <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/get-into-a-novel-via-virtual-reality">More information</a>.

                In March of 2019, Joycestick was given the opportunity to present at the 2019 Game Developers Conference. My portion
                of our 3-person talk entitled "Virtual Reality Learning: The Interdisciplinary Future of Literature" was a post-mortem on the project from my perspective as the producer and teaching assistant, 
                and (b) thoughts on how more diverse talent pipelines for indiscipline projects can be built. <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1026479/Virtual-Reality-Learning-The-Interdisciplinary">Slides here</a>.

                to learn more about 3D graphics and consider careers in the industry.
