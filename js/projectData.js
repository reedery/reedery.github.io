    "description": "Vortex is a performance-based 3D animation toolkit for mobile video creators. It allows users to create and share 3D animated videos by composing a set of performances on characters, cameras or props in space and time. In addition to performing object motion via touch-screen input, Vortex allows you to use your mobile device's AR tracking to animate. Inspired by Mandalorian-style virtual production, Figma, multitrack recorders and music/video editors, Vortex aims to make CGI accessible to any creator to explore creative ideas. <a href='https://medium.com/teleportal/made-in-vortex-166daa63c074'>Read more about Vortex here.</a>",

    "description": "Teleportal is a platform that allows XR developers and content creators to create shared, persistent experiences that are networked in real-time. It works across platforms (iOS / Android / VR / PC / Mac) and interfaces with the Unity game engine. Teleportal seamlessly synchronizes user locations and coordinate systems between devices, allowing developers to focus on creating their experience. It also automatically saves and retrieves persistent items in the shared geo space. Teleportal SDK integrates with existing Unity projects, converting them into crossplatform XR apps. The long-term vision is that XR, the combination of virtual and mixed reality technologies, is key to the future of collaboration, digital media, and the Internet itself. <a href='https://medium.com/teleportal/announcing-teleportal-the-xr-telepresence-platform-350a710c4c0a'>Read more about Teleportal here.</a>",

    "description": "Jurassic World: VR Expedition is a location-based VR experience at Dave & Buster's arcades. It's a quick, fun ride that immerses players in the Jurassic World universe, set between the first movie and its sequel. Players sit in a bouncing row of seats, wearing HTC Vive headsets, and go on a virtual off-road jeep tour through the park's wreckage. The ride includes a game element where players tag dinosaurs using a handheld Vive controller, similar to the N64 game Pokemon Snap. The experience features close encounters with velociraptors, a T. rex, and a giant mosasaur, all synced with the motion of the seats and realistic wind effects. The ride, created by Universal and The Virtual Reality Company, is designed for fast turnaround, easy use, and accessibility, costing only $5 per play. It showcases how VR can be effectively used in short, exciting experiences in arcade settings.",

To make a video with Movieoke, simply perform the lines on-screen and Movieoke's performance capture system tracks your face and voice to apply it to a 3D character in real-time. Inspired by Animoji, Vine, and Snapchat, Movieoke aims to make 3D animation creation more accessible, improvisational, and fun than ever before. Designed for the next generation of video creators, especially teens familiar with 3D creation in virtual worlds like Roblox and Minecraft, Movieoke believes that most 3D animation content in the future will be created through performance rather than keyframes. The ambition is to help creators channel their creative energy in completely new ways and transform animation from a slow art to a fast art.

    "description": "MovieBot is an AI-powered 3D animation platform that transforms text into animated video instantly. Users simply type a story topic and MovieBot generates an interactive 3D movie with talking characters based on the prompt. It offers a simple UI for generating movies, allowing users to choose characters, voices, worlds, and script styles. Every generated movie is a 3D scene that can be remixed in the Story Editor. MovieBot aimed to make 3D animation, traditionally a complex art form requiring desktop computers and technical skills, accessible on smartphones. The development process prioritized user feedback and community input. A key lesson learned was that while earlier versions focused on user performance, pivoting to AI proved more successful in terms of content shared online. MovieBot was also featured on the Dr. Phil show. <a href='https://youtu.be/1nOCuDtxdRo'>Watch the Dr. Phil feature here.</a>",

I led this project from ideation, to securing the URF grant funding through to development by a team of nearly 30 students from Boston College, MIT, Northeastern and Berklee School of Music. The experience breaks the story up logically by chapter and represents each through objects and images. These are translated into interactive scenes that uncover aspects of the story as the player progresses. Featured in Boston Globe, NYTimes, London Times and demoed at literature and technology conferences around the world including Signapore, Dublin, Seattle and New York.",
