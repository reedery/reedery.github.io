    "description": "Teleportal is a platform that allows XR developers and content creators to create shared, persistent experiences that are networked in real-time. It works across platforms (iOS / Android / VR / PC / Mac) and interfaces with the Unity game engine. Teleportal seamlessly synchronizes user locations and coordinate systems between devices, allowing developers to focus on creating their experience. It also automatically saves and retrieves persistent items in the shared geo space. Teleportal SDK integrates with existing Unity projects, converting them into crossplatform XR apps. The long-term vision is that XR, the combination of virtual and mixed reality technologies, is key to the future of collaboration, digital media, and the Internet itself. <a href='https://medium.com/teleportal/announcing-teleportal-the-xr-telepresence-platform-350a710c4c0a' target=\"_blank\">Read more about Teleportal here</a> and view the archived <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200202004243/https://teleportal.dev/docs/\">Developer Docs</a>",

It's a quick, fun ride that immerses players in the Jurassic World universe, set between the first movie and its sequel. Players sit in a bouncing row of seats, wearing HTC Vive headsets, and go on a virtual off-road jeep tour through the park's wreckage. The ride includes a game element where players tag dinosaurs using a handheld Vive controller, similar to the N64 game Pokemon Snap. The experience features close encounters with velociraptors, a T. rex, and a giant mosasaur, all synced with the motion of the seats and realistic wind effects. The ride, created by Universal and The Virtual Reality Company, is designed for fast turnaround, easy use, and accessibility, costing only $5 per play. It showcases how VR can be effectively used in short, exciting experiences in arcade settings.",

Inspired by Animoji, Vine, and Snapchat, Movieoke aims to make 3D animation creation more accessible, improvisational, and fun than ever before. Designed for the next generation of video creators, especially teens familiar with 3D creation in virtual worlds like Roblox and Minecraft, Movieoke believes that most 3D animation content in the future will be created through performance rather than keyframes. The ambition is to help creators channel their creative energy in completely new ways and transform animation from a slow art to a fast art.

Users simply type a story topic and MovieBot generates an interactive 3D movie with talking characters based on the prompt. It offers a simple UI for generating movies, allowing users to choose characters, voices, worlds, and script styles. Every generated movie is a 3D scene that can be remixed in the Story Editor. MovieBot aimed to make 3D animation, traditionally a complex art form requiring desktop computers and technical skills, accessible on smartphones. The development process prioritized user feedback and community input. A key lesson learned was that while earlier versions focused on user performance, pivoting to AI proved more successful in terms of content shared online. MovieBot was also featured on the Dr. Phil show.",
