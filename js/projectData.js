     (project info on this site) to Movieoke at the end of 2021 to build a better UX around our learnings and better assist creators in overcoming the blank canvas\
      problem.<br><br>Our team came up with Movie Karaoke as a fun way to reimagine storytelling with 3D Animated characters on a mobile device by putting facial\
      capture and voice recording at the center of the UX. The UI was designed like Snapchat’s camera and having scene templates with a teleprompter made for creators\
      to get started. Our product team of 6 artists/engineers built and released 20 Movieoke versions from April ’22 to March ’23 (at which point Movieoke became MovieBot).\
      The 2.0 release was notable: it introduced UGC scenes and a custom character creator. These updates significantly improved the creation funnel (51% more recordings,\
      17% more exports).<br><br>My role during this time was multifaceted. Externally I was responsible for investor updates and internally, my main duty was as\
      product manager working with our lead engineer and designer on scoping eng/tech art sprints to plan upcoming releases. As an individual contributor, I would\

      or Unity UI. I also managed release engineering and publishing app updates to Google Play/App Store after each sprint once a build passed QA. <br><br>In 7\
