  "description": "Joycestick reimagines James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em> in Virtual Reality. I led this project from ideation, to securing the URF grant funding through to development by a team of nearly 30 students from Boston College, MIT, Northeastern and Berklee School of Music. The experience breaks the story up logically by chapter and represents each through objects and images. These are translated into interactive scenes that uncover aspects of the story as the player progresses. Featured in Boston Globe, NYTimes, London Times and demoed at literature and technology conferences around the world including Signapore, Dublin, Seattle and New York.",
