  "description": "MovieBot is an AI-powered 3D animation platform that transforms text into animated video instantly. Users simply type a story topic and MovieBot generates an interactive 3D movie with talking characters based on the prompt. It offers a simple UI for generating movies, allowing users to choose characters, voices, worlds, and script styles. Every generated movie is a 3D scene that can be remixed in the Story Editor. MovieBot aimed to make 3D animation, traditionally a complex art form requiring desktop computers and technical skills, accessible on smartphones. The development process prioritized user feedback and community input. A key lesson learned was that while earlier versions focused on user performance, pivoting to AI proved more successful in terms of content shared online. MovieBot was also featured on the Dr. Phil show. <a href='https://youtu.be/1nOCuDtxdRo'>Watch the Dr. Phil feature here.</a>",
