							<!-- <blockquote>"Listening to the data is important… but so is experience and intuition. After all, what is intuition at its best but large amounts of data of all kinds filtered through a human brain rather than a math model?” – Steve Lohr, New York Times </blockquote> -->
							<p>In the Spring semester of my sophomore year at Boston College I took an Information Systems course with <a href="http://www.samransbotham.com/cv">Prof. Ransbotham</a> called Analytics and Business Intelligence.
								At the time, I was apprehensive about my studies. I didn't have a major, and my creative pursuits felt worthless as a kid at a university driven by its business school–
								one of the best in the nation for undergrads. I was the odd one out in a course
								focused on the managerial implications of data science full of MBAs and business students. And while I could
								care less about the case studies, I became fascinated with the math, engineering and creative possibilities of the tech being discussed.
							</p>
						<p>We used Tableau, R and Python to build models for our <a href="data/yelp.html">final project<a> in which we anayzed a
							subset of the Yelp Academic dataset. I grew close with Prof. Ransbotham while working on the project, and at the end of the semester,
							he strongly recomended that I study computer science (to which I obliged-- my GPA never recovered).</p>

							<!-- might reuse this stuff -->

						  <!-- <p>The rest is history. And although I'd always had an affinity for understanding machinines, ripping electronics
								apart and even jailbreaking others' iPhones in high school for extra cash, studying CS gave me a new appreciation
								for the impressiveness of the devices and applications we use each day, how incredible the technical infastructure
								our society is already built upon is, and what the future has in store given how much data everyone/thing produces
								each day. </p> -->
						  <!-- <p>Piggy-backing off my similar interests in the realm of <a href="vr.html">Virtual Reality</a> (VR), I decided to
								build a project for <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/bcnews/campus-community/students/posterseason.html">Big Data
									Research Day at Boston College</a> that would help explain how sensors in smartphones and VR headsets make this
									technology possible. While most projects at BIg Data research day focused on big data as a reference to the volume
									of data being analyzed, <a href="data/streaming.html">this project took a look at the speed at which data needs
										to be processed</a> to maintain a suitable framerate and not induce motion sickness. </p> -->

										<!--
							  <p>While studying the intracacies of different types of learning models and the trade-offs between them, I was working on a semester-long project for Algorithms (CSCI 3383).
									The project was simple: given an image, a dataset of images and an integer <em>k</em>, find the <em>k </em>most similar images in the dataset to the given images. We were
									allowed to assume that all of the images were binary matrices ( just 1s and 0s) and that were to be graded on a tradeoff between speed and accuracy with speed being most
									important. Given the fact that my mind was in ML mode, our group ended up taking an approach <a href="data/images.html">synthesizing techniques from Computer Vision, Machine
										Learning and Algorithmic Analysis and can be found here.</a></p>
							  <p> My relationship with data science and anlytics predated and even pushed me towards taking the step towards studying Computer Science. But even with years of academic and
									practical knowledge using and implementing different machine learning models, the gap between what I know and what I seek to understand in this field continues to grow. </p> -->


						  <p>As my understanding of computers and how to program them was reaching an 'over-the-hump' feeling, I was only a few months from graduating. As a capstone of my CS education,
								I decided to take Machine Learning (CSCI 3345 Fall '16) with <a href="http://cs.bc.edu/~alvarez/">Prof. Alvarez </a>where I would be forced to leave my comfort zone in math and CS.
								That experience took my understanding of the theory, methods and applications of artifical intelligence to a whole new level.
								The cummulation of my coursework here yielded a project that took a look at the <a href="data/simpsons.html">effectivness of Recurrent Neural Networks</a> for
									text generation compared to a Markov Model. The <a href = "http://amlbook.com/">textbook</a> is among the favorites in my library.</p>
